# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Luca Zhou

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques.

1. We will use **Matplotlib** and  **Seaborn** to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to stories of multiple variables.
2. We will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in the first part. The primary method of conveying our findings will be through transforming our **exploratory visualizations** from the first part into polished, **explanatory visualizations**.

## Prerequisite

We will use Python 3, and the IDE we will be using is Jupyter Notebooks. Uses the Anaconda distribution to install Python is highly recommended since it includes all necessary Python libraries and Jupyter Notebooks. Besides, the following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

* NumPy
* pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Objectives

* Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
* Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing us to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
* Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.

## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If we selected your own dataset, make sure we note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that we performed before we started your exploration.


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether we plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Select one or two main threads from your exploration to polish up for your presentation. Note any changes in design from your exploration step here.
