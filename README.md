# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
## by Luca Zhou

Data visualization is an essential skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques.

1. We will use **Matplotlib** and  **Seaborn** to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to stories of multiple variables.
2. We will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in the first part. The primary method of conveying our findings will be through transforming our **exploratory visualizations** from the first part into polished, **explanatory visualizations**.

## Prerequisite

We will use Python 3, and the IDE we will be using is Jupyter Notebooks. Uses the Anaconda distribution to install Python is highly recommended since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries and Jupyter Notebooks. Besides, the following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

* NumPy
* pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.


## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Select one or two main threads from your exploration to polish up for your presentation. Note any changes in design from your exploration step here.
